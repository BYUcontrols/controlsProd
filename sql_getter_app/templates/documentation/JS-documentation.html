Hi! Welcome to the AC controls app's javascript! So glad you could make it!

Here I will attempt to outline how the client-side code is organized and how it functions.

    linked element - when a table references a row from another table. For instance the device table 
        has a column called 'buildingId' that contains integers. Those integers reference the id numbers
        in the 'Building' table. This is so that a building row can be edited without also having to
        go through and edit all places that building is referenced.
    ref - In the code variables ?Ref are html Reference objects. Which are portals from the html
        to the javascript. If you have questions google is your friend.

Objective

    This is a web interface for the BYU ac shop's sql database that...
        - Displays tables
        - Sorts, prints, paginates, filters, and hides columns on the table
        - Allows editing rows, creating new rows and undoing those edits
        - Replaces linked columns with their counterparts
        - Creates a quick inspect icon that brings up a singular editable linked row
        - Allows users to go to a linked elements table and choose a row and be automatically redirected
        - Can handle the data types: varchar, bool, int, linked, decimal, datetime, and date
        - Displays an audit history for the tables and allows you to restore a row
        - Shows a view linked icon that shows all the places a row is referenced

Table Overview

    The actual html for the tables themselves is created in python by an instance of the 
    createTableHtml class, while the supporting elements (table functions, new entries, and 
    audit tables, and linked elements) are created by the JS function initialize.js/startup() 
    that runs onload of the html body. Most of what startup() does is straightforward with
    the notable exception of the rowEngine(). Miscellaneous data that we want to pass to
    the JS from the server is passed through the html template table.html into a &lt;script> 
    and declared as global JS variables. So if you're scratching your head over where a variable
    is declared it's probably there.

<a name='row'></a><a href='#top'>Top of page</a>
rowEngine

    To make linking elements, editing, and all the datatypes much easier we have created a class
    called the rowEngine(). At its core the class is an interface between a htmlRow element and
    the rest of the code, allowing ease of data access, editing, and saving. It is a wrapper for
    a row of data and handles all the different data types.
    
    When a new instance of the class is Called it...
        - takes the a columnsObject (as created by initialize.js/generateColumnsObject())
        - creates the 'this.fields' array of cell's with each cell being an instance of the cellEngine
            the cellEngine class is talked about in the next section
    Once the row is initialized we can either load a table row or create input fields (or do something custom
    like what we do with service requests);
        - this.loadRow()
            = puts the html ref of a cell in the this.fields array
            = obtains the id number for that row from the row html: &lt;tr data-id='#'> and stores it
            = looks for an editing cookie (more on those later) for that row and 
                loads that cookie into the row
            = creates the row buttons (edit, save, undo, audit, select (if applicable), etc.) using 
                the this.createOptionsButtons() member
        - this.generateInputFields()
            = creates an input field for every this.fields
            = loads the values of the fields from a cookie if it exists
            = creates a save button that calls the this.saveRow() member
    Lastly there are a couple functions available to perform actions on the rowEngine
        - this.editRow()
            = loops through the this.fields and saves the value of each cell into this.backupObj
                and calls .edit() on each cell to make it editable
            = change the appearance of the row to signal to the user that it is being edited.
        - this.getValues()
            = gets all the values of all the cells in the table by calling .getVal() on each cell
        - this.saveRow()
            = uses this.getValues() to get the values then adds some daa that the server needs and
                sends the save request to the server
            = If in airplane mode this does nothing but runs onSaveReturn()
            = we can pass this.saveRow an object which is saved en lieu of the actual values 
        - this.onSaveReturn()
            = a function that runs when the request sent in this.saveRow returns with a success.
            = undoes the visual editing cues from this.editRow()
            = calls .restoreCell() on all the cells (restoring them to an unedited state)
            = we can pass this.onSaveReturn() an object which is passed to .restoreCell().
                this makes it so that we can replace different values to the row
        - this.undoRow()
            = Uses the this.backupObj from this.editRow() to undo changes from 2 states:
                1. if the row is being edited we pass this.onSaveReturn the backupObj
                2. if we are not editing we must have already saved so we pass this.saveRow()
                    the backupObj to save, which in turn passes the backupObj to this.onSaveReturn()
                    to update the values
        - this.deleteRow()
            = prepares and sends a request to the server to delete the row
        - this.finishDelete()
            = Runs on return of the request sent in this.deleteRow()
            = erases the row's html (removing it from the view of the user)
        - this.unDeleteRow()
            = Sends a request to the server to unDelete the row
            = on return of the request we reload the page

<a name='cel'></a><a href='#top'>Top of page</a>
cellEngine

    Represents a cell and has functions for editing the cell, restoring the cell, getting the value of
    the cell, and get a value by which to sort a cell. This is complicated by the fact that we have to 
    deal with a bunch of different data types. An integer needs a different editing box then a boolean
    or a linked column. We handle the difference in data type at the lowest possible level (here). This
    allows us to not have to worry about data types higher up in the app where we have lots of other
    stuff to worry about.

    - constructor()
        = takes the passed columnObject (generated by initialize.js/generateColumnsObject())
            and breaks it up and stores it in the object
        = call this.assignMembersForType()
    - this.assignMembersForType()
        = a bunch of if statements that look for different types
        = for each type it assigns the:
            this.edit()
            this.sortVal()
            this.getVal()
            this.restoreCell()
        variables with the corresponding function for that type.
        = if the type is 'linked' we grab a few extra variables from the columnObject
    - this.getVal_****() group
        = this group gets the value for the cell and returns it
        = if the argument 'pair' is true then it passes the value with the columnName like
            {colName:value}
    - this.edit_******() group
        = this group takes a 'val' argument (default is the value of this.getVal )
        = clears the cell
        = puts in a editable field (box, dropdown, etc.)
        = assigns the field with the 'val'
    - this.restoreCell_*******() group
        = also takes an optional 'val' argument
        = clears the cell
        = puts uneditable text into the cell (the 'val')
    - this.sortVal_******() group
        = some data types have values that wouldn't work to be sorted by
            for instance a linked column's value is an integer but we want to sort by the
            text displayed to the user.
        = returns the sortable value for the cell.
        = also if editing we want to sort by the unedited value for the cell that way the row
            doesn't jump around while the user is typing

<a name='lnk'></a><a href='#top'>Top of page</a>
Linked Elements

    There are a few columns among the tables that are pointers to a row in another table.
    An example would be in the Device table the row for buildingId is an integer that references
    a row in the Building Table. This enables the creation of very powerful tables, but also
    makes things SO much more fun to code. These linked elements are handled mainly by the rowEngine.

    Here is their flow:

    1. The raw linked data as a dictionary of dictionaries is passed through either the &lt;script> as global
        variables or in the &lt;table> header for subTables (Audits, Linked Children, Deleted, Quick Look).
    2. The initialize.js/generateColumnsObject() function takes the raw data and assigns it to its
        respective columns
    3. The RowEngine takes the generatedColumnsObject and passes it to the linked column's cellEngine
    4. which then creates a dropdown to select the linked elements when editing a linked cell.

<a name='cki'></a><a href='#top'>Top of page</a>
Cookie progress saving

    When the user exits a page their editing and new Item progress is saved in localStorage tied to 
    that page's path. Here are the involved functions:

        - initialize.js/window.addEventListener("unload") - sets and defines a 
            function to run when the page unloads. The function saves the rows and newItem being
            edited as cookies by calling the .getValues() member of the rowEngine class and passing
            the returned object to publish.js/setStorageItem()
        - when a RowEngine is initialized and .loadRow() or .generateInputFields() is called they
            they look for storage items referring to them using publish.js/isStorageItem() and if 
            there is then they load the row with the stored values using publish.js/getStorageItem()
        - When a row is saved, undone or deleted its edited cookie is removed using
            publish.js/removeStorageItem()

<a name='red'></a><a href='#top'>Top of page</a>
Redirect handling
    
    When editing or creating a row, the user may want to visit a linked table to create a new row
    or select a row with more information. To facilitate this we open the page for the linked table 
    then send them back when they are done. Here are the functions that handle this in sequential order:
    
        1. publish.js/redirectHandler() is called when a ('Table') button (when editing a linked element) is clicked
            and redirects the user to a given new page with a url parameter containing the current page and 
            column and row being edited. We also pass the function to be called when a select button is pressed (step 5)
        2. publish.js/checkForParentWindows() is called on startup in the initialize function and checks to see
            if the current page has been opened by the redirectHandler() of another page. If that is the case
            then we put up a message using unobtrusiveAlert() and set the global variable displaySelectButton to true
        3. when RowEngine.loadRow() is called it checks displaySelectButton and if true creates 'Select' buttons 
            that call publish.js/nextPage() so that the
            user can select a row and be redirected back to the original table
        4. publish.js/nextPage() is called by a 'Select' button or when a new item is saved and sends the user
            back to the original page and calls the function passed to the redirect handler in step 1, passing the new index.
                - getting the selected index is easy for a row, but for a newItem we check the return of the 
                    post request which should contain the generated index.
        5. nextPage() calls the function passed in redirectHandler(), which in our case is defined in 
            newEditClass.js/rowEngine/edit_linked(). It sets the dropdown to the id passed by nextPage()
            and if the dropdown does not contain the id (the id was just created) then it asks the server
            for it thorough /updateLinkedObject url.
        
<a name='req'></a><a href='#top'>Top of page</a>
Server Requests

    For a lot of the operations in this app we need to be able to talk to the server without reloading the page.
    This functionality is what separates a website from an app, an app is interactive and dynamic. To talk to the
    server we have created a newItem.js/post() function that handles requests and uses the javascript XMLHttpRequest
    class. Its arguments are...

        1. data (anything that JSON.parse can process)
            The data to be sent to the server
        2. type (string)
            the request type in all caps: POST, PUT, GET, etc.
        3. url (string)
            the relative url to send the request to (eg. '/pata')
        4. finishFunction (function)
            a function that will be called on successful return
        5. dataToPass (any)
            data that will be passed to the first argument of the finishFunction
            
    The flow of the function is...

        1. create the request with the url and data
        2. create a loading graphic on top of the page to let the user know we are loading 
        3. send the request
        4. assign the request something to do when it loads:
            if successful (200) - run the finishFunction passing the context of the request
            if sql error (472) - alert the user to the error and pass them the error
            if server error (500) - alert the user
            if unauthorized (403) - alert the user and reload the page to log them back in
            if timeout - alert the user
        5. remove the loading graphic
        6. return the engine that way we can assign more data to the request that
            will then be passed to the finishFunction()


Table functions - the functions that make viewing the table easier

<a name='srt'></a><a href='#top'>Top of page</a>
Sort by

    Creates the ability to choose which column to sort by and which direction to sort by
    functions are located in tableFunctions.js

        1. generateSortSelect() creates the select and configures: 
            - the select to call sortTable() on change
            - the up/down arrow to call sortCall() on click
        2. sortCall() changes the global variable reverse to true/false and runs sortTable()
        3. sortTable() sorts the table based on the selected column and direction   
            the actual sorting is done by our sortRowsArray() function
        
<a name='dis'></a><a href='#top'>Top of page</a>
Displayed columns

    To declutter the table the Displayed Columns 'dropdown' allows the user to choose which columns are displayed. It also saves its
    state in a cookie. The flow is as follows: -- all functions are located in tableFunctions.js --

        1. generateDisplaySelect() creates the selector using the columnsInfo variable generated by initialize.js/generateColumnsObject()
        and checks the cookie to saved configurations
        2. handleColumnVisibility() loops through the table and hides the columns hidden as defined by the global displayedColumns dictionary
            created by generateDisplaySelect()
        3. handleCheckboxChange() is called when a checkbox is clicked (set by generateDisplaySelect()) and updates displayedColumns and runs 
            handleColumnVisibility()

<a name='prn'></a><a href='#top'>Top of page</a>
Print

   An important part of a database is the ability to print reports. The print button generates a pdf and opens it in a new tab with whatever
   is currently displayed on the table. All the functions are in print.js

    1. generatePrintButton() is called on startup and creates a print button that when clicked calls redirectPost(makeDocument())
    2. makeDocument() takes the table and prepares it for printing
    3. redirectPost() takes the data from make document and sends it to /print and opens the return data in a new tab.

   the /print url takes raw html and turns it into a pdf

<a name='fil'></a><a href='#top'>Top of page</a>
Filter

   Filtering a table is essential for finding what you want, and how we do it is to let the user pick what they want to filter in the filter menu
   and then reloading with the 'filter' url argument that contains the filter data. The python then filters using that data and the new pages filter
   menu is automatically filled in. The js for filtering can be found at filter.js

    1. generateFilterButton() creates a filter button and if there are filters in place alerts the user. The filter button calls...
    2. filterMenu() which creates the filter menu (or unhides it if it already exists) using the global columnsInfo object and creating instances
        of the filterOption class which are stored in an array so that we can access the filter values later
    3. applyFilter() takes the array created in filterMenu() and gets the filter values, parses them and reloads the page with the new filter url parameter

  The filterOption class handles all the different operations and data types available and is fairly straightforward to read through. 

<a name='del'></a><a href='#top'>Top of page</a>
Show Deleted

   Each table has a sql audit table. To view the items deleted from a table we send a request to /showDeleted, which returns a table with the deleted rows.
   the functions are in deleted.js unless otherwise specified 

    1. generateShowDeletedButton() - creates the button and links it to showDeleted()
    2. showDeleted() - creates a window and sends the get request and runs displayDeletedData() on the request return
    3. displayDeletedData() is very similar to Audit. It:
        - puts the data in a table and displays it in the popup box
        - loads the rows using audit.js/loadForeignRow()

<a name='pag'></a><a href='#top'>Top of page</a>
Pagination

    To make readability and functionality easier on the page we can show the rows 'page' at a time. To fix the annoying
    problem of not being able to quickly click through through pages all the rows load when the page loads and the 
    'pages' are simulated. Additionally the paginated state is saved using a cookie Here is the flow:

        1. the constructor of pagination.js/paginationEngine class is called at initialize.js/startup() and creates the 'Show:' and
            'Showing:' dropdowns.
        2. pagination.js/paginationEngine.setPaginateScale() populates the 'Showing:' dropdown with ranges of values to select based on
            the range selected at 'Show:'. It is called at:
                pagination.js/paginationEngine - at startup
                tableFunctions.js/sortTable() - for when the user sorts by a new column
                onchange of the 'Show:' dropdown - for when a new range is selected
        3. pagination.js/paginate() actually hides all rows that are not in the range of the 'Showing:' dropdown.


ROW BUTTONS - perform actions on rows

<a name='btn'></a><a href='#top'>Top of page</a>
edit, save, and undo 

    these are created by the rowEngine during newEditClass.js/loadRow(). They take an instance of the rowClass
    and perform the appropriate operations

<a name='aud'></a><a href='#top'>Top of page</a>
Audit

    1. created by the rowEngine which passes an instance of itself to audit.js/auditTable()
    2. audit.js/auditTable() is called on click of the Audit button and creates a window and sends a request to /getAudit
    3. audit.js/displayAuditData() runs on the request return and...
        - creates a copy of the reference using audit.js/createCloneOfRow() which...
            = copies the actual html ref
            = creates a new rowEngine instance
            = sets a custom save and delete function for the copy rowEngine that saves/deletes the original and copy
        - puts the returned audits in a table and runs quickLook.js/loadForeignRow() which...
            = gets the linked and column data from the response header
            = loads the row into a rowEngine object
            = creates the restore button using quickLook.js/restoreElement() which...
                > creates a button that on click...
                > compares a reference columnsObject (from the actual table) to the columnsObject
                    for the row being restored
                > saves the columns that are the same from the row being restored to the original reference row 

<a name='lkb'></a><a href='#top'>Top of page</a>
Linked 

    Displays all the places that the row is referenced (ie the BRWB row in the Buildings table will be referenced by
    all the devices, oit jacks, etc that are in the BRWB). It does this in a way almost identical to the way Audits
    are displayed with the only difference that instead of an option to restore a row it allows you to edit, delete,
    etc the referenced rows.

<a name='sel'></a><a href='#top'>Top of page</a>
Select

    When you click the 'XXX Table' button when editing a linked field it opens that table and there
    you can select a row. The select button facilitates this. Here's the flow:

    1. When you click 'Edit' on a row (or in a create new) the rowEngine for that row calls its edit() functions.
        If the cell is linked it calls newEditClass.js/rowEngine/edit_linked(), which creates a dropdown for the
        linked table and creates a 'XXX Table' button.
    2. Clicking this button calls publish.js/redirectHandler(), which opens a new window in the browser with the
        requested table. The cool thing is, that when you open a new window using javascript you can interact with
        that opened page and that page can interact with you (through the 'opener' variable). So...
    3. When any new table page is loaded the first thing the initialize.js/init() function does is call...
    4. publish.js/checkForParentWindows() looks to see if the current page has an opener page and if that page has the
        global variable window.dataForChildPages (which redirectHandler() created) and that dataForChildPages has a reference
        to the current page (the current page is being selected). If checkForParentWindows() decides that the page needs
        select buttons it sets the global variable window.displaySelectButton to true and alerts the user to the fact.
    5. There are two ways that a user can select a row: a select button or by creating a new row.
        Select buttons - newEditClass.js/rowEngines check to see that they are native rows and that they should display the row 
            (using window.displaySelectButton) in newEditClass.js/rowEngines/loadRow(). if so 
            newEditClass.js/rowEngines/loadRow()creates select buttons that when clicked call publish.js/nextPage() 
            (with the row id passed)
        New row - When a new row is created (using newItem.js/post()) the server returns the created Id. newIem.js/post()
            looks for that Id and passes it to publish.js/nextPage()
    6. publish.js/nextPage() calls the onSelect() function contained in the dataForChildPages (onSelect is defined in 
        newEditClass.js/rowEngine/edit_linked() and passed to publish.js/redirectHandler() which creates the dataForChildPages)
        with the selected id as an argument. It then closes the page.
    7. The onSelect function was defined in newEditClass.js/rowEngine/edit_linked() and so can access the dropdown where the 
        'XXX Table' button was pressed in the first place and set the dropdown to the selected id (back on the original page)

    An edge case exists where when the user creates a new row to be selected and is redirected back to the original table the 
    original table doesn't have any idea what the selected row is because its window.links object was created by the server way before
    the new row was created. To solve this in step 7 when onSelect is called if it can't find the selected id in the 
    window.links object it sends a request to the server ('/updateLinkedObject') asking for the info on the created row. Once the
    request comes back it recreates the dropdown and updates the window.links object.

The little magnifying glass on linked elements

    To facilitate quick viewing of an entire linked element we put a little magnifying glass there
    that brings up the whole row in a window at the bottom of the page. For instance if you were
    looking at the Device Licence table and wanted to find out more about the device being licensed
    you would click the magnifying glass next ot the device. It works very similar to Audit in that...

    1. quickLook.js/showLink() sends a request to /linkedElement 
    2. quickLook.js/onLinkedReturn() runs when the request returns and...
        - creates a popup box
        - removes the loading icon
        - puts the returned row into a table
        - loads that row with quickLook.js/loadForeignRow()

    </pre>
